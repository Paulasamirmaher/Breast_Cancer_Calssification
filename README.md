# Breast_Cancer_Calssification
This breast cancer classification project uses machine learning to predict whether a case is malignant or benign. The data is preprocessed with scaling techniques, hyperparameters are tuned with grid search, and features are selected using permutation importance. The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics.
